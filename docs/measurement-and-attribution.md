# Measurement & Attribution 

Tracking the effectiveness of both organic and social media campaigns is essential for optimizing performance, justifying investment, and identifying high-converting audience segments. 

This section outlines how to measure impact across channels with precision.

 ### 1. UTM Parameters: Traffic Source Tracking

To identify where your traffic and conversions are coming from, all outbound links shared on social platforms should include UTM parameters.

**Example Link (LinkedIn organic post):**
```
https://www.indosoft.com/request-demo?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=october_campaign
```

**Best Practices:**

* Use lowercase naming conventions (utm_source=facebook, not Facebook)

* Keep naming consistent across all campaigns to allow easy filtering

* Track campaigns individually for demo pages, lead magnets, etc.

**Standard UTM Tags:**
| Parameter              | Example                     | Purpose                              |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| utm_source             | linkedin / facebook         | Which platform the traffic came from |
| utm_medium             | social / paid_social        | Organic or paid classification       |
| utm_campaign           | awareness_oct / demo_launch | The campaign being tracked           |
| utm_content (optional) | demo_cta_btn / carousel_ad  | Helps distinguish post variations    |

### 2. Google Analytics 4 (GA4): Platform Setup

GA4 should be fully configured to capture traffic and events from social platforms. It automatically tracks page views and source/medium — but for full insight, additional setup is required.

**Recommended Setup:**

* Ensure Enhanced Measurement is enabled.

* Create custom events for important actions (e.g., button clicks).

* Mark critical actions as Conversions within GA4.

* Enable Google Signals for better cross-device tracking.

**Key Views in GA4:**

* Reports > Acquisition > Traffic acquisition
See which channels (e.g., linkedin / social) are driving the most engaged sessions.

* Reports > Engagement > Events / Conversions
Track how many users are clicking CTA buttons, filling forms, etc.

* Exploration > Funnel Analysis
Visualize how users move from landing pages to conversion points.

### 3. Event Tracking (Click & Form Tracking)

To understand user behavior beyond just page visits, set up event tracking for:

* CTA button clicks (e.g., “Request Demo”)

* Form submissions (lead gen forms or contact forms)

* PDF downloads (if using downloadable lead magnets)

**Implementation Options:**

**Google Tag Manager (Recommended):**
Set up click listeners and define triggers for specific button IDs or CSS classes.

**Manual GA4 Event Snippets:**
Embed directly in CTA links/buttons, e.g.:
```
onclick="gtag('event', 'click', { event_category: 'CTA', event_label: 'LinkedIn Demo Button' });"
```


**Facebook Pixel & LinkedIn Insight Tag:**
Use their respective tracking tags to record off-site actions, such as form submissions or landing page views

### 4. Conversion Attribution

It's important to not only track what actions users take but where they originated from.

**Multi-Touch Attribution:**
GA4 offers attribution modeling tools to show which channels assisted in conversions, not just the last click.

**Key Models:**

* Data-driven: Uses machine learning to assign weighted credit to touchpoints

* Last-click: Credits the final source before conversion

* First-click: Useful to see which campaigns drive initial awareness

* Use Case: A user discovers Indosoft via LinkedIn, then returns from Google a week later and fills the demo form. Both interactions are valuable.

### 5. KPI Tracking & Benchmarks

| KPI                                   | Target                           |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Click-Through Rate (CTR)              | 1.5–3% (organic); 2–4% \(paid\)    |
| Engagement Rate                       |\>3% on average posts             |
| Website Session Duration              | 1.5–3 minutes                    |
| Bounce Rate                           | \<50% on high-intent pages        |
| Cost per Lead (if paid)               | \<$80 \(LinkedIn\),\<$30 \(Facebook\) |
| Conversion Rate (from landing pages)  | 2–6% depending on offer          |
| Social Conversions (from UTM sources) | \+10–20% MoM growth target        |

### 6. Reporting & Review Cadence

**Weekly Review (internal):**

* Top-performing posts by engagement

* Website traffic from social sources

* Any anomalies in click or conversion behavior

**Monthly Strategy Check-In:**

* Compare organic vs paid performance (if used)

* Review conversion rates and funnel drop-offs

* Adjust CTA wording, post timing, or visuals based on patterns

**Quarterly Review (executive level):**

* Overall lead growth from social

* Cost efficiency of optional paid spend

* Benchmark vs industry standards
