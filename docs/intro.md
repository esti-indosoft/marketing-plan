# Strategic Website Awareness & Promotion Plan

### Introduction 
**Why This Strategy important now**

As AI-driven platforms such as Google’s SGE, Bing Copilot, and ChatGPT continue to advance, the way users discover content and make buying decisions is fundamentally shifting.

According to recent research from Gartner (https://www.searchenginejournal.com/why-generative-ai-isnt-killing-seo-its-creating-new-opportunities/549678/) and Pew (https://www.pewresearch.org/data-labs/2025/05/23/what-web-browsing-data-tells-us-about-how-ai-appears-online/), 

a growing share of users now rely on AI assistants for early product research, often bypassing traditional search engines altogether. This compresses the buyer’s journey and challenges long-held assumptions about how and where prospects engage with brands online.

While SEO remains foundational, brands can no longer rely solely on search engines to generate visibility and leads. Social media now plays a critical role in visibility strategies, allowing companies to directly reach, engage, and retarget decision makers especially in B2B sectors.

### The Role of Social Media 
**in Awareness and Traffic Growth**

Social media, particularly LinkedIn and Facebook, provides strategic benefits for B2B tech companies:

**1. Direct Access to Decision-Makers**
Platforms like LinkedIn enable hyper-targeted outreach to professionals by title, industry, and company size.

**2. Increased Brand Recall**
Consistent visibility in newsfeeds and groups reinforces your product’s presence in the minds of your target audience.

**3. Traffic Diversification**
By generating traffic outside of SEO/SEM, social helps reduce dependence on algorithms and increases resilience.

**4. Improved Search Visibility**
Strong social engagement can indirectly influence SEO by improving branded search volume and backlinks.

**5. Faster Feedback Loops**
Real-time engagement helps test messaging, positioning, and offers more efficiently than search.

For Indosoft, building a steady organic presence on Facebook and LinkedIn will support long-term brand positioning and lead generation as the web search landscape changes.
